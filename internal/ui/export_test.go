// Test-only accessors, so the external ui_test package can assert against the
// real tables and constants rather than hand-copied duplicates of them.
//
// The duplicates are the point. Issue #103 was a key that existed in the router
// and in no keymap the operator could see; a test that spells the keymap out a
// third time cannot catch that, because it drifts with neither. These make the
// production values themselves the fixture.

// LeaderKeys is every documented leader binding's key.

// Footers is every footer constant by name, so a width assertion measures the
// constant rather than the rendered line - which fitLine has already capped to
// the window and which therefore cannot fail for an over-long footer.
